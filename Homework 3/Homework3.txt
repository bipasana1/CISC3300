Question 3 and 4

3. Compare and contrast margin, padding, and border.
  Margin is the space outside the border of an element. It creates space between the element's border and surrounding elements.
  Padding is the space inside an element, between its content and its border.
  Border is the line that surrounds the padding of an element.
  Margins control the spacing outside the element, padding controls the spacing inside the element, and borders create a visible boundary around the element.

4. Define the following flexbox css rules
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/:
a. display: flex - enables a flex context for all its direct children.
b. flex-direction - the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.
c. flex-wrap - allow the items to wrap as needed with this property instead of trying to fit onto one lime.
d. justify-content/align-items - defines the alignment along the main axis.
                                - This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. 
e. align-content - aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
